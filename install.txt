NEW INSTALLS (Standalone) - for CMS please see the online docs
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Download
Seems pretty simple, but it's worth stating. First you've got to download Jinzora. You can get Jinzora from the following

Jinzora Downloads Page

We suggest that you create a "jinzora" directory to save your download to so you can extract it next


# Extracting
Once you've got Jinzora downloaded you'll need to extract the download to your web server.

Windows: On Windows we recommend using Winzip to extract the downloaded .zip file (assuming that's the file you downloaded).

*NIX: On *NIX you'll need to do a: tar -zxvf jinzora-X.X.tar.gz (where X.X is the version number) to extract Jinzora to the current directory

Note: Jinzora WILL create a subdirectory called "jinzora"


# Preparing
Windows Users: You MUST make sure that the jinzora directory from above is located with in your webserver's root directory (c:\inetpub\www by default). Virtual directories are NOT currently supported (support is planned for the future). You can have your media on a different drive IF and ONLY IF you are using NTFS (see symlinking in Using Jinzora)
You also need to make sure that the webserver has at least read access to the directory you've extracted Jinzora to (which it should unless you've changed things...)

*NIX Users: To make installing Jinzora on *NIX easier (and for those that have SSH access) we've provided a script that will setup everything for Jinzora's installation. Please simply run:

sh configure.sh

FTP Only Installtations: If you do not have SSH access and only have FTP access (or similar) please see "FTP Only" installation in the menu for details.

Inside the Jinzora directory. This will create the necessary files and setup the proper permissions so the web based portion of the installation can complete (if you don't have SSH access don't worry, see FTP Only installation for assistance)


# GD Libraries
To take advantage of the image resizing functions in Jinzora you'll need the Boutell.com GD image libraries. To install these (these are ROUGH guidelines)

Windows Users:
1. Download the GD Library from us (or get it on the net...)

2. Unzip it to the exact same directory where PHP is installed (c:\php)

3. Edit php.ini (usually in c:\winnt or c:\windows) and edit the following line:
extension=php_gd2.dll (REMOVE the ; at the beginning of the line)

*NIX Users: This can be a bit more complicated on *NIX, so we recommend you view the installation guide located at Boutell.com for assistance


# Web Installer
Now that you've gotten everything ready, browse (in your favorite web browser) to

http://yoursite/path/to/jinzora/index.php

And you'll be taken through the web based installer. The web based installer is fully documented and should describe each option that you'll have along the way.

At the very end the installer will create two files for you. The files settings.php and users.php will be generated, and if possible, be written to the server for you. If the installer can't write these files you'll be able to download them manually. You'll need to upload these 2 files to the root directory of the Jinzora installation. Once you've uploaded these files you'll be able to go to the index page for Jinzora.



UPGRADING
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Upgrades should be very simple.  All you need to do is extract Jinzora on
top of your current install and replace everything.  Your settings file
will not be overwritten and the installer will allow you to "Upgrade" your
installation and migrate all your settings in.

Be aware that if you are using the default "music" directory that it WILL
be overwritten when you upgrade.  We suggest that you either backup this directory
or even better create a "my-music" directory and use that as your media
directory in your settings.php file
