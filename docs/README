What does Jinzora do?
======================
In a nutshell it creates easy to use, highly functional web pages out
of your media and allows you to access your media from anywhere anytime.
Jinzora's requirements are quite simple enabling it to run on many
different setups in many different ways


Requirements
============
Operatings Systems
* Supported Operatings Systems *NIX (all flavors should work just fine)
* Windows (98-2003)
* OS X (10.x)

Supported Webservers Apache 1.x/2.x
* IIS 4.x/5.x/6.x
* Sambar (limited testing)
* Any webserver that supports PHP (theorically)

Supported CMSes Postnuke .726 and higher
* PHPNuke 6.5 and higher
* NSNNuke 0.2.4 and higher
* Mambo 4.5 and higher

Supported Media Players Winamp 2.x - 5.x

* noxmms (supported for Jukebox Mode Only!)
* Windows Media Player 7.x-9.x

PHP Versions
* PHP Versions 4.x (Supported)

Hardware
* This is a hard one, as Jinzora will run on just about any hardware that would support the above list. There are a few things in Jinzora that are a little CPU intensive, namely the reading of the information from the ID3 tags. We test and run Jinzora on a minimum of: PIII 600 Mhz
* 256 MB Ram
* 120 GB of disk space for Media (although this is not a requirement at all)
